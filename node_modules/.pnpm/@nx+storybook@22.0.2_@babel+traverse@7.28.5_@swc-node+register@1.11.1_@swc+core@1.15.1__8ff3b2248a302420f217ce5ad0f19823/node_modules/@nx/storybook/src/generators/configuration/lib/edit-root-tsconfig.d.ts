 * This is a temporary fix for Storybook to support TypeScript configuration files.
 * The issue is that if there is a root tsconfig.json file, Storybook will use it, and
 * ignore the tsconfig.json file in the .storybook folder. This results in module being set
 * to esnext, and Storybook does not recognise the main.ts code as a module.
